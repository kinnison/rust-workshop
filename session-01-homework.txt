# Session 1 homework

First up, have you remembered to take a look over the `Path`, `PathBuf`, `File`,
and `BufRead`/`BufReader` materials? Have you had a good go at understanding
what `Option<T>` and `Result<T,E>` are? If not, bear in mind you'll likely need
to revisit those items at least a little through this homework session.

Across the early weeks, problem 1 will be a warmup task using the things learned
in that week's session, stretching you a little by being not the most complete
of problem descriptions.

However problem 2 will be building up week on week.

So while your solutions to problem 1 can be throw away, you'll be able to think
ahead with problem 2. But don't work ahead or you might skip important steps
as we move through the weeks.

At the end of session one we had covered hopefully enough about IO that you
can easily load the input data below, but if you need reminding, please recheck
what was recommended in the session.

Your answers to the homework questions should be cargo binary projects which
function as per the instructions. To submit your homework, please ensure that
you have deleted the `target` directory (where cargo puts its build artifacts)
before you tar, or zip it up.

If you prefer, you can store your homework in a git repository, so long as that
repository is shared with me, and you email in an indication of which branch
and what commit SHA you want me to consider your homework.

Submissions are due on the morning of the day before the next session. While
there is no formal "mark" for your homework, sending it in will give me time to
review any issues which people had, so that we can start the next session with
a discussion of common issues etc. Problems you have _will_ shape the rest of
the course, so please do not fail to submit your homework.

If you want to submit early and/or ask questions, then feel free to do so at any
point up to the final submission deadline.

## Problem 1: Adding up numbers

You have an input file whose content is as follows (ignoring the obvious
start/end markers and the indentation, i.e. the first line is '14' and the
last is '46'):

    ---8<---
    14
    9
    -7
    1
    5
    0
    -2
    9
    1
    -100
    -75623
    65536
    -100
    5
    2
    15100
    46
    ---8<---

Your goal is to write a program which when run as follows:

    $ cargo run -- inputfilename

will read the contents of `inputfilename`, break it into lines, parse each line
as a number of some useful type, sum all the numbers, and print the sum to stdout.

If any of the lines does not parse as a suitable number, please just return
the error out of your main function, using the techniques we learned in the
10 green bottles example.

Bonus points if you make interesting use of `Iterator` methods.

Note: You should test your program with good and bad inputs, and make sure that
it reports errors as you'd expect.

I will not use the exact name `inputfilename` nor the exact number sequence
above when I test your program, so do not cut corners here. Use what we learned
during session one.

## Problem 2 - In for the long haul

You now have an input file with the following content:

    ---8<---
    This is your input file

    Anything which is not one of the important characters will be ignored
    by the program

    The program is as follows:

       +[-
         [<<
          [+
           [--->]
          -[<<<]
         ]
        ]>>>-
       ]

    I'm guessing that you know where we're going with all this

       >-.---.>..>.<<<<-.<+.>>>>>.>.<<.<-.

    But perhaps you're as lost as a little lamb?
    ---8<---

As some of you will likely know, this is a program in the [Brainfuck][] language.

For now, we're not going to be writing anything as complex as a Brainfuck
interpreter, though we will be building one in the future so bear that
in mind as you write today's homework answer.

[brainfuck]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck

For today, please write a program which, when run as:

    $ cargo run -- inputfile

will read `inputfile`, reduce it to the list of valid Brainfuck characters
(i.e. strip out all of the comment characters) and then print out the
program. There are eight valid command characters, and they're listed in
the Wikipedia article.

You can do this entirely with things we've already considered, by means of
iterators you can find on `BufRead` and on `str`, and with judicious use of
`match` and `print!()/println!()`

However, for bonus points, make use of `Vec<char>`, `Vec<u8>` or `String` and
learn how to use `collect()` from the `Iterator` trait.

Note: You'll want to get hold of as many different valid Brainfuck inputs as you
can to try it out. I will not be holding back with my test cases, so be as thorough
as you can.
